_Work in progress_

A super minimal node.js blog platform for simplicity and elegance.

Can run as a standalone server or be published as a static site.

Used together with Github or Heroku publishing is as simple as a `git push` or `npm run publish`.

Heavily inspired by [Void](https://github.com/josephernest/void)
